# Welcome to my wiki

This wiki is created to document and shape my working process for the séminaire *Humanitées numerique* in the Printemps semestre at the University of Neuchâtel. The topic is going to be an analysis of data on the semantic web about **Archaeologists**. Around that, I will document my general workflows, data exploration and at some later point probably also data analysis.
